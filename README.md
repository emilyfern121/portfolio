Emily Fernandez Portfolio 

This portfolio was created from scratch. It includes the following items:       
- header
- navigation bar
- hero image with text overlay
- about section 
- sample work section
- contact section 

The header is a simple design with my full name and naviagtion bar with links directly to the corresponding sections of the page. The about section includes a recent headshot and placeholder text for a brief bio. The work sample section has a grid layout. The project names appear on the image when the mouse is hovering. Please note that I am still building my portfolio which is why I have placeholder images. The contact section includes icons and links to my phone number, email address and LinkedIn page.
